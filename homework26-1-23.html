			Murder in The Alps

		</h1>

		<p>
			The air was cold. That's all she remembers from The Alps. Even with her layers, the cold air still chilled her bones. In front of her was a lone child in a red dress, shivering in the cold. She could see teartracks frozen on her face. Behind her, she saw Harvey. Harvey launched at the girl, her claws grasping the girl's neck. The girl smiled at the woman before her eyes rolled up. Her eyes were fully white, and then they were red. The girl collapsed before her. She didn't have time to question where Harvey disappeared off to, all she could think about was the girl that laid in the pure snow, her blood staining the already red dress and the snow around her. She carefully cradled the pale girl as she slowly died.

			"There will be blood," the mountains whispered.

		</p>

		<p>
			Indeed there will.
